          <p>
            Hello, my name is Brian Shanken and I am an aspiring web developer. My background is a bit different from
            most in the field. I first ran into computing languages while pursuing my undergraduate degree in Physics. I
            had the opportunity to take a directed study focusing on plasma physics and using computational physics to
            work through real data with the University of Iowa. This was where I first learned the joy of communicating
            with a computer. The research eventually was <a
              href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263126603_Analysis_of_Magnetic_Fields_in_Inertial_Alfven_Wave_Collisions"
              class="published" target="_blank">published</a> and I graduated from Valdosta State University.</p>
          <p>Shortly after college, I was hired as a Business Analyst and found myself working with computers in a new
            way. This time, instead of researching for plasma to find new patterns, I got to use more commonplace data.
            My work mostly focused on using sequel databases and working with a custom CMS. I have switched from running
            simulations to pulling actionable insights out of large volumes of performance data.</p>
          <p>My next challenge came in the form of customer-focused activity. I took a position as a Marketing Analyst
            in the B2B manufacturing field. We had the unique challenge of creating leads from being industry experts.
            Our motto was to deliver solutions and not sell products. I started in the position, as you would expect an
            analyst to perform, mostly collecting data on initiatives and then presenting the findings. Soon my role
            switched when I discovered the capabilities of our marketing software, Pardot, to build and host landing
            pages. This became a pivot point in my role. I was charged with developing and designing the landing pages
            for our ads and social media efforts. I challenged myself to increase the conversion rate and UX with each
            page I built. As my pages became more polished and I saw more success in my efforts, I realized I found my
            passion. I decided to pursue becoming a full web developer. </p>
          <p>I am currently enrolled in a bootcamp program, through Georgia Tech, to learn all the skills I will need to
            perform at the top level in the field of web development. Feel free to look around my site and get a
            first-hand look at my new passion.</p>
